This is just a short update to mention that we'll be at TwitchCon this weekend. We'll be connecting with friends, doing a bit of networking and looking for ways to improve the content we're broadcasting. Make sure to follow us on twitter to stay up to date on what's going on.

There will definitely be a longer post mortem done after the event has ended and we've had some time to process the weekend. Some part of it will be done on stream on Monday the 29th, so check the events page on the twitch channel.

Until then...
