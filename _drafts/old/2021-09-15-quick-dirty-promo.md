Short video I did. Sorry about the delay, busy as fuck and trying to get so many things managed. Finally getting back to some messages I owe folks.

So the way I did it was pretty much cheating. I used a mac. Setup should be straight forward though on windows and I'm working on duplicating the process on my desktop.

Here's the breakdown:

 - Rehearse the shit out of what I wanted to accomplish.

 - Screencapped it and reviewed until I felt like I got it. On a mac, I used Quicktime Player because it does the best non-streaming screen cap for the the platform. I could have used OBS to capture streamlabs (and that is probably where I'll start on my windows desktop) but I was trying something quick and dirty and it worked out well.

 - Once I got the raw recording I liked, I trimmed it down so that I only got what I needed. Meow note, I said trimmed and not edited. Edits in fast video don’t quite work well. If I was doing time lapse, it might be easier to edit things out. Haven’t played with it yet.

 - Used an online image processor for a quick and dirty speedup of the process. I think it’s going at 2x the speed of what I recorded. Here’s the link:  https://www.onlineconverter.com/change-video-speed

 - Check the final result that it lets you download and post as such.

Meow this was again a quick and dirty thing I did while experimenting with the idea. I’m already working on better ways to do that and will be incorporating the approach in some promo stuff.
