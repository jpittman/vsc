It’s been a while. A lot longer than I hoped for and a lot has happened between. Between reflecting on my actions and my own mental health, it’s been a tough road.

I just wanted to take a moment and express some gratitude. I have a lot of things to be grateful for, but I’m most lucky because of these basic things.

I’m grateful to still be breathing.

I’m grateful I have my family.

I’m grateful I still have friends.

And I’m grateful to you for reading this.
