Welcome to the quiet launch of this site. Great things often begin as small things and this is a small thing determined to be great.

The goal here is to create a signpost that marks where to discover vary bits about the content we're creating out there on the internet. It will point you in the direction of streamed shows, published game content and social media ramblings. We'll take a moment and break down what the site currently offers and then we'll talk about possible futures.

# News

This section will cover announcements and updates to the site, various projects and shows that are we're involved in.

# Shows

Shows that are currently hosted on [twitch](https://twitch.tv/videostorecowboy) or published to [youtube](https://youtube.com/) will land here. Pages will include show descriptions, show summaries (with links to where to catch the VODS) and cast lists. Additional show materials that are published will also be included (when applicable).

# Projects

Games hacks, show materials and other various little published content will find a home here. We've written a number of projects already and will be updating and editing them for publication here. This will get announced in the News section when that happens.

# Future

The idea of launching a site to collect all of this material is ambitious. As a small content creation group for tabletop gaming, we were looking to find a way to easily share what we're working on. Managing this type of site does take time and we plan to do our best in making sure that you get the best experience out of it.

For the future, we'll be sharing the details of how we run our streams, how we create the game materials we do and what we want to do in collaborating with other content creators online.
