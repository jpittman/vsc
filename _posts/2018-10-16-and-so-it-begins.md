Welcome to the quiet launch of the Video Store Cowboy site. Great things often begin as a small thing and this is a small thing determined to be great.

The goal here is to create a signpost that points you in a direction where you can discover various bits about the content we're creating. You'll find details about streamed shows, published game content and social media ramblings. Eventually, you'll find updates to current content and additions pointing you in new directions.

For now though, we'll take a moment and break down what the site currently offers.

# News

News will cover announcements and updates to the site, various projects and shows that are we're involved in. The plan is for it to be a low volume, high value conduit for the latest information we have to share.

# Shows

Shows will cover content that that is currently hosted on [twitch](https://twitch.tv/videostorecowboy) or published to [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbt-ENZEzvr6ui-sNb3f2UA). Pages will include show descriptions, show summaries (with links to where to catch the VODS) and cast lists. Additional show materials that are published will also be included (when applicable).

# Projects

Games hacks, show materials and other various little published content will find a home here. We've written a number of projects already and will be updating and editing them for publication here. This will get announced in the News section when that happens.

# The Future

Future plans include sharing the details of how we run our streams, how we create the game materials we do and what we want to do in collaborating with other content creators online. Keep an eye on the [News](/news.html) section for announcements and updates about future projects.

# Finally

The idea of launching a site to collect all of this material is ambitious. As a small content creation group for tabletop gaming, we were looking to find a way to easily share what we're working on. Managing this type of site does take time and we plan to do our best in making sure that you get the best experience out of it.
