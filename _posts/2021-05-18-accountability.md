***Content Warning: Harrassment, Language***

In February of 2019, I made a mistake. Here's the tweet I wrote about it:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tonight I did something I’m not proud of.<br><br>While on stream tonight, running a game as the GM, I referred to the main female antagonist as a “bitch” when she was eliminated from the fight.<br><br>Immediately after what I said, I realized my mistake and felt the need to make amends.</p>&mdash; VSC (@vidstorecowboy) <a href="https://twitter.com/vidstorecowboy/status/1100605982499958784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

When this happened, I understood my mistake, understood what my accountability was in the situation and acknowledged it in the best way I knew that I could: I apologized. The thread for the above tweet apologizes first to the players at the table (and the one absent), second to the community for the channel I was participating on, and third to the extended community at large. This series of steps were clear to me at the time, in large part because of a previous experience from 2018 that had helped me understand how my behavior can sometimes have an impact on others.

That past experience from 2018 was not publically acknowledged until it was addressed on July 3rd, 2020:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">-Encounter Roleplay: inappropriate messages, use/abuse/lose cycle<br>-VidStoreCowboy/VideoStoreCowboy*: public humiliation, not respecting “no” *&amp; UMG with whom I shared what happened &amp; still games w/ him<br>AND there’s another I still don’t know how to talk about yet <a href="https://t.co/GNWWb7ut8N">https://t.co/GNWWb7ut8N</a></p>&mdash; ThatSaltyGinger (@ThatSaltyGinger) <a href="https://twitter.com/ThatSaltyGinger/status/1279233531156115457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/wigets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

At the time in 2018, I didn't understand my mistakes and didn't immedately apologize. With the help of some friends and collaborators, I  finally came to understand how I had hurt Lauren. With the understanding, I did my best to address my actions. Unable to resolve it directly with her, I instead worked to minimize any future trauma by disengaging from the situation. I made changes to the way I run ttrpg games and I didn't acknowledge the situation publically. I thought I was handling it appropriately.

I now understand that I should have publically apoligized then, regardless of the resulting response. I chose not to address it publically because I wanted not to cause her any further harm. That was a mistake. I did feel like I carried the weight of the guilt from the unresolved situation and it did change my behavior. My apology in February 2019 was one of the results of that experience.

When she finally spoke up publically in 2020, I understood what I needed to do. I took action to acknowledge it first privately with all of my collaborators at the time, stepped away from the majority of my commitments and then addressed it publically with a formal apology:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;d like to beg your indulgence for a moment and acknowledge this statement about my past actions:<a href="https://t.co/OC7G2Qfw8R">https://t.co/OC7G2Qfw8R</a><br><br>I’m not going to dispute Lauren’s statement of experience. She deserves better. What happened was my fault and I would like to apologize for my actions.</p>&mdash; VSC (@vidstorecowboy) <a href="https://twitter.com/vidstorecowboy/status/1280064079353180160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 6, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And then I stepped away. Time was needed. It was the right thing to do.

It's been 10 months since I officially stepped back. I'm writing this now to understand the impact these experiences have had on me. I can't speak to the impact that addressing me had on Lauren, but I can only hope that she has gained some catharsis in the telling.

For me, the past months have been hard as I consider the resulting personal and professional fallout from July 2020. I've lost friends, I've lost work and time on projects and my mental health has suffered. I feel the loss of being unable to resolve a situation where I harmed someone.

I'm writing this to understand the situations that have brought me here, to be accountable to myself and my mental health. I understand this is one mistake, that I have made others and that I need to keep learning to be better. To acknowledge that at some level, the only change I can affect is my own.

I need to forgive myself and to let it go. The world has moved on and it's time for me to do so.

I'm sorry Lauren.
