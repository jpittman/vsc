In July of 2020, I was publicly addressed for my behavior on a streamed Twitch TTRPG show. The behavior dates back to March of 2018 and the person who addressed me labeled my behavior as harassment. At the time, I made a public apology and mostly stepped back from the TTRPG community on Twitter and Twitch.

For the better part of 9 months, I've been thinking about Accountability. Specifically, personal accountability and reconciliation. I've done a lot of research and reading, trying to find the answer to a basic question: How do I rebuild trust? The more I read, the more I didn't understand the answers I was seeing.  Recently though, the pieces finally clicked into place and the answer was obvious. It just wasn't the answer I was looking for.

I don't. I don't build back the trust. I don't get to choose that.

I can only do better, be accountable, and hope that others will put their trust me again.

So I'm doing that. In February of 2021, I did the 28 Days project. The goal was to educate myself and acknowledge the issues that have become important to me.  I shared what I learned with others. That has led to me doing a lot of writing about my experiences in trying to figure this out. The accountability project is the next phase of this experience. It's a way to track the things I'm doing so that I know where I've been in this process.

It’s time to get back to work. I hope you’ll join me.
