Being content creators for tabletop rpgs, we often have more ideas than we care to admit. There are pages and pages of notes in various forms (electronic or physical) that outline or detail an idea for a project that may never actually see the light of day. It's a known part of the experience for any creative.

Another aspect of this experience are the suggestions we receive from folks. It often comes in various forms of communication (verbal, social media, discord and even email) and usually involves them asking us to play their favorite game. Sometimes, it's a suggestion of something new that has launched on kickstarter. When those come in, it can be hard to managing tracking the suggestion, who suggested it and the feasibility of the idea in the grand scheme of things.

# Ideas

So we're going to take a crack at solving that problem and launch the [ideas](https://ideas.videostorecowboy.com/) tool. It's web tool that allows anyone to suggest something for us to tackle and let's us manage how we communicate the status of the idea you are suggestion. Along with the link in this post, you can find it on the front page of the site.

## Here's How It Will Work

When you have an idea an idea for us, you head over to the  [ideas](https://ideas.videostorecowboy.com/) tool and add it there. When it comes in, we'll take a look figure out if we can do it (and it's something we would normally do or be into otherwise). If we can tackle it, we'll figure out what it takes to put into production is and we'll update the idea there.

When something goes from planning to actually being being put into production of some kind, we'll post there and also an update to the [news](news.html) section of the site. It'll appear either on twitch, youtube or someplace else we can publish to.

## See It In Action

There are already a number of ideas posted there by a good friend of ours, Brahms. A couple of his ideas are already in the planning stages and should be in production shortly. Keep an eye on the [ideas](https://ideas.videostorecowboy.com/) tool or the [news](news.html) section for more details.
