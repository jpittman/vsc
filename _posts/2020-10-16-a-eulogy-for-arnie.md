On October 10th, there was a death in my extended family. Specifically, a dog by the name of Arnie.

I was and still am pretty much destroyed by the loss. I wrote a Eulogy and you can find it [here](/essays/a-eulogy-for-arnie.html).

Originally, I was going to share it as a post. I've decided instead to create a new [Essay section](/essays/essays.html) of the site, as there are some other things coming down the pipe that I've written and will be including some other things I've written.

Miss you, Arnie.
