Last week saw the release of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. After catching it opening night, I was inspired to hack together a one page rpg for the Wizading World setting. It's called Aurors and the descriptive text for the setting focuses on profession of [dark wizard hunters](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Auror).

It's based upon the [Blades in the Dark SRD](https://bladesinthedark.com) and takes a rules lite approach to the setting. This allows the players to focus on a more narrative game in practice and allows the GM to focus on telling a larger story. The first version of the rules were written up in a 24 hour period of time. 

The one pager was actually played as one of the games on [UnMadeGaming's](https://twitch.tv/unmadegaming) 12 Hour Charity stream for the month of November. The cast for that charity stream were the first players to get their hands on the rules and had plenty of feedback.

You can find the first release of [Aurors](/projects/aurors/aurors.html) in the projects section. There is an update in the works clarify a couple of rules, add a couple of more and simplify the setting text for the Wizarding World. Expect an update in the near future.
