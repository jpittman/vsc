Last week saw the release of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald and I was inspired to hack together a one page rpg that allowed me to run a game in the setting of the Wizading World.

This one page rpg is based upon the Blades in the Dark SRD and takes a rules lite approach to the setting. You can find the first release of [Aurors](/projects/aurors/aurors.html) in the projects section.
