# Accountability

In July of 2020, I was publicly addressed for harassment on Twitter. The circumstances took place in March of 2018 during a Twitch TTRPG show.  When I was addressed, I made a [public apology](https://twitter.com/vidstorecowboy/status/1280064079353180160) and mostly stepped back from the TTRPG community on Twitter and Twitch.

In that time since July 2020, I have been working on understanding the impact my behavior had and how I can do better.

This page is one part of my work towards accountability. It’s here so I can address my behavior and acknowledge the steps I’m taking to make things better. It is a work in progress. While the layout may change, it will maintain the content. If you have any comments, questions or concerns, please contact me so that I can address them appropriately.
